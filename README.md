# GGJ19 - Cosy Quest

Theme was "What does home means to you?" For us, being "cosy" is the most important, wherever you are.
Customize your own house in this small game by diving in your dreams to change your reality.

Done for the Global Game Jam 2019

We decided to fix stuff on the game so the playable version isn't the result at the end of the GGJ, you have to get [this commit](https://github.com/Inateno/GGJ19/commit/54c702057c8c73ff24b019ceb28261167e14f584)
